# Installation pre-requisites

For taking the course we recommend installing Node 14. These are some tutorials to install node in different operating systems:

- [Install Node and NPM on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ODS6RM6x7g)
- [Install Node and NPM on Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUdHk-Dk_BY)
- [Install Node and NPM on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imj8PgG3bZU)

To easily switch between node versions on your machine, we recommend using a node virtual environment tool such as [nave](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nave) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), depending on your operating system. 

For example, here is how you switch to a new node version using nave:

    # note that you don't even need to update your node version before installing nave
    npm install -g nave
    
    nave use 12.3.1
    node -v
    v12.3.1

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli 

# To Run the Development Backend Server

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start 

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

# Commands to create store

To add store to Auth Module (creates a reducer folder and adds store provider in the module)

ng generate store auth/Auth --module auth.module.ts
